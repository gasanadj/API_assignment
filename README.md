# Journey To Expertise

This program uses the Rapid API's `Tech Exams` and `Dad Jokes` api to make education more fun and engaging.

## How it works
This program contains multiple exercises from various papers. A user has the choice to which paper they want to try out. There is also an option to get all the questions and try them out, and later check out the answers after you are done. Once you are tired, there's an option to choose `Dad Jokes` to bring a smile to the tired face.
